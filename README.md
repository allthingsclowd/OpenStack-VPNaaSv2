# OpenStack VPNaaS v2 Example Angular GUI

This repository has example code that illustrates how both OpenStack and Fujitsu Cloud Service K5 APIs can be wrapped in an Angular GUI to provide end users with simplified tooling.

The APIs are delivered as Angular services and could quite easily be used directly in a NodeJS application - when I've more time I'll stick them in an NPM repo.

There's much more than VPNaaS coded here, however I've only presented the VPNaaS to provided a dedicated VPN tool.
